# Building a Roomba game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Roomba game allows the user to place a dirt patch and the start point of the
roomba on the 5x5 grid. They can then use the compass to guide the roomba to the
dirt patch.

##Â To download and install this programme:
- Run 'git clone https://github.com/mdaguilar66/roomba-project' in your terminal.
- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm start'
- Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

## I first broke the problem down into user inputs:
- Location of patches of dirt
- Hoover location
- Driving instructions

## And outputs:
- Final hoover position (X,Y)
- Number of patches of dirt left

## I decided to use React JS to build this project:
React JS is a Javascript library used to build HTML elements and is particularly
useful for building dynamic user interfaces and breaking a project into separate
components (which I considered this project to have). In order to use React, I
needed to have Node JS installed on my computer.

## I broke the project down into separate components:
- App
- Grid
- Tile
- User inputs
- Compass
- Compass and grid wrapper
